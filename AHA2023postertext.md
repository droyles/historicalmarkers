# Lynching and the Landscape of U.S. Memory: A Quantitative Investigation of Historical Markers of Anti-Black Violence

## Introduction
This analysis represents a first attempt to quantify the ways that anti-Black violence is memorialized in the U.S. landscape, using the text of historical markers as an object of investigation. Since the middle of the 19th century, and especially in the years between the end of the Civil War and World War II, lynching was used to maintain the system of white supreamcy in the U.S., and especially in the South. During this time, thousands of African Americans were lynched—some because they had been accused of serious crimes, and others because they had merely not shown whites the deference that they expected. Recognizing the history of anti-Black violence in the U.S. is a small but important step toward dismantling white supremacy; by surveying the extant landscape of lynching markers, this analysis contributes to that effort.

## Methods
This analysis is based on data exported from the [Historical Marker Database](https://www.hmdb.org/) (HMDB), a crowdsourced repository of digital representations of  over 180,000 "permanent outdoor markers, monuments, and plaques." A search for the term "lynch" was conducted across the database on November 30, 2022, and a rough dataset of 663 markers exported. Non-U.S. sites and those with proper names such as "Lynch" and "Lynchburg" were removed, yielding a revised set of 235 markers. Markers not relevant to the history of anti-Black lynching, such as those dealing with the lynching of white victims, were then removed, yielding a final set of 158 markers.

Each of these markers was coded according to whether it commemorates one or more specific lynching murders, refers to lynching as a form of racial terror, or describes efforts to oppose lynching. This dataset was then analyzed, using data provided in the original export from HMDB, to assess *what stories* these markers tell, *where* these markers are located, *when* they were erected, and *by whom*.

## Results
First and foremost, the history of anti-Black lynching is underrepresented in historical markers in the United States. While the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) has documented nearly 6,500 lynchings of African Americans between 1865 and 1950, only 117 markers (74.1%) deal with specific lynching murders. Since some markers describe multiple murders, the number of victims represented is greater than the number of markers. Additionally, only markers that use some variation of "lynch" are included, which means that other markers dealing with racially motivated murders that do not use the term don't appear in the dataset.

Second, the majority of markers appear in former Confederate states, representing 93 markers (55.7%) of the dataset. This is not surprising, given that the majority of anti-Black lynchings occurred in these same states. However, there is no necessary relationship between the number of lynchings and the number of lynching markers in a given state. For example, EJI has documented 654 lynchings of African Americans in Mississippi between 1877 and 1950, more than any other state. But Mississippi only has two markers in the dataset, fewer than almost any other state. In contrast, Pennsylvania has three, although EJI only records two lynchings of African Americans during the same period.

Third, many of these markers have been placed very recently. Information about when markers were erected is available for 130 markers, comprising 82.3% of the dataset. Of these, the median marker was erected in 2019. Morever, 104 markers (80%) of those for which such information is available have been erected since 2015, the year following the Ferguson uprising.

Finally, this dataset shows that EJI has played a significant role in shaping the public landscape of lynching memory. Of the markers in this dataset, at least 63 (40%) were erected by, or in collaboration with, EJI.

## Conclusions
The memorialization of lynching in the U.S. built environment vastly underrepresents the practice as a form of anti-Black racial terror, and is both very recent and closely tied to the work of a single organization. This is perhaps unsurprising, given ongoing public battles over efforts to accurately represent the history of racism, and particularly of racist violence, in the U.S., as well as the groundswell of organizing by the Movement for Black Lives and allied groups over the last decade. However, this analysis also points to the uneven nature of this memorialization, with relatively higher numbers of markers in deep South states such as Alabama, compared to very low numbers in neighboring Mississippi.

## Further Research
This dataset might be marked up with additional information, such as the names of victims and relevant dates, which would allow for other types of analysis and visualization. The data might also be appended to includeracist murders of African Americans that are not named as lynchings. For example, markers that tell the story of Emmett Till are not included here because they do not use the word "lynch." Other types of violent incidents, including race riots and racial expulsions, might be included as well, in order to gain a better understanding of the extent to which anti-Black violence is represented on historical markers across the country.

## Key Takeaways:
- the history of anti-Black lynching is underrepresented in historical markers in the United States
- the majority of markers appear in Southern states, but the number of recorded lynchings does not correlate to the number of lynching markers
- most lynching markers have been placed recently
- the Equal Justice Initiative has played an outsized role in placing lynching markers
