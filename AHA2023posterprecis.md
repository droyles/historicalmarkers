# Lynching and the Landscape of U.S. Memory: A Quantitative Investigation of Historical Markers of Anti-Black Violence

Poster presentation by Dan Royles (Florida International University) at the 2023 annual meeting of the American Historical Association

This analysis represents a first attempt to quantify the ways that anti-Black violence is memorialized in the U.S. landscape, using the text of historical markers as an object of investigation. Data for this analysis was exported from the [Historical Marker Database](https://www.hmdb.org/) (HMDB), a crowdsourced repository of digital representations of over 180,000 “permanent outdoor markers, monuments, and plaques.” Each marker was coded according to whether it commemorates one or more specific lynching murders, or refers to lynching in the abstract. This dataset was then analyzed, using data provided in the original export from HMDB, to assess _what stories_ these markers tell, _where_ these markers are located, _when_ they were erected, and _by whom_.

Key findings from this analysis:

1.  The history of anti-Black lynching is underrepresented in historical markers in the United States. While the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) has documented nearly 6,500 lynchings of African Americans between 1865 and 1950, only 117 markers (74.1%) deal with specific lynching murders.
2.  The majority of markers appear in former Confederate states, representing 93 markers (55.7%) of the dataset. However, there is no necessary relationship between the number of lynchings and the number of lynching markers in a given state. For example, EJI has documented 654 lynchings of African Americans in Mississippi between 1877 and 1950, more than any other state. But Mississippi only has two markers in the dataset, fewer than almost any other state. In contrast, Pennsylvania has three, although EJI only records two lynchings of African Americans during the same period.
3.  Most markers have been placed very recently. Information about when markers were erected is available for 130 markers, comprising 82.3% of the dataset. Of these, the median marker was erected in 2019. Moreover, 104 markers (80%) of these have been erected since 2015, the year following the Ferguson uprising.
4.  EJI has played an outsized role in shaping the public landscape of lynching memory. Of the markers in this dataset, at least 63 (40%) were erected by, or in collaboration with, EJI.

The memorialization of lynching in the U.S. built environment vastly underrepresents the practice as a form of anti-Black racial terror, and is both very recent and closely tied to the work of a single organization. This memorialization is also uneven, with relatively higher numbers of markers in deep South states such as Alabama, compared to very low numbers in neighboring Mississippi. Further analysis of historical markers using additional search criteria will build a more complete picture of the ways that anti-Black violence is represented in the memorial landscape in the U.S.
